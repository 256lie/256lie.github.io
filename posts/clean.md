>  Clutter reflects attitudes about the environment, mirroring internal states of control. However, excessive amounts of cleaning can indicate a compulsion and intolerance towards a natural level of disorder, leading to obsessive habits and repulsions, which can cause neurotic fragility and fatigue. Please clean responsibly.

[Cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cleaning) is the process of removing unwanted substances from an object or an environment. This behavior manifests in many contexts and across varying scales of organization --- from the individual to institutions --- but is most commonly associated with biological organisms. Many social animals practice mutual grooming such as cats, birds, and primates.

Cleaning is demonstrated in organisms such as the aptly named [cleaner fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaner_fish), which forms symbiotic relationships with other aquatic species, providing them cleaning services in exchange for nourishment. Some other species of fish have evolved to mimic the conspicuous coloration of the cleaner fish to gain a competitive advantage, which diminishes the effect of mutualism from actual cleaner fish.

In humans, widespread practice of cleaning likely coincided with the transition from nomadic-hunter tribes to agrarian-based settlements, in which labor was divided between the sexes, normalizing gender roles through genetic/cultural traits/behaviors that ingrained these divisions into gender associations. The subsequent growth in population and rise of social-economical partitions subsequently led to elaborate hierarchies that delineated groups through stratification of caste (*e.g.* ethnicity, nobility, wealth) and the development of rituals and enforcement (through custom, rules, and laws) of city-states, kingdoms, and empires. Power and control concentrated in a privileged few while the masses of underclass served them through abiding labor (sometimes for mutual benefit in the continuation of traditional belief systems which made for a relatively more stable society). The Victorian period exemplifies the lavish excesses afforded by the hierarchical specialization of servants. Industrialization continued to preserve these inequalities of through feedback mechanisms Now, commercialization of cleaning services is routine and encompass specialized cleaning occupations: chimneys, windows, carpets, and swimming pools. Entire sectors such as the semiconductor industry necessitate clean environments free of dust and other particulate matter and employ elaborate air filtration systems and formalized procedures to ensure satisfactory levels of cleanliness.

**What are the side effects of cleaning?**

Removal of ecological pollutants from inhabited environments is usually considered beneficial in society, although externalities can prevent proper disposal of some types of waste. For the individual and family, a clean household can have beneficial health effects such as lower rates of allergies and diseases from harmful bacteria, fungus, and insects. Cleaning can also have acute psychological effects. Failure to regularly clean oneself or one's living spaces can indicate possible mental disorder, such as depression or [hoarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarders_(TV_series)). However, excessive cleaning is correlated with obsessive-compulsive personalities and neuroticism. The act of cleaning can emotionally symbolize an individual's agency or exercised volition, a power to be able to directly influence one's surroundings through the act of cleaning. However, any activity necessary expends energy resources and some have utilized strategies such as [simple living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living) to reduce the amount of material possessions that need cleaning, as well as to signify a rejection of modern consumer society; freedom from the objects that occupy and clutter not only physical but mental space.

**A philosophy of cleaning**

The repetitious and pedestrian characteristic of cleaning is a Sisyphean task --- a never-ending balancing of our desire to instill order in a chaotic world that suppresses the individual through continual reminders of mortality and insignificance. In tidying up what we can, we are comforted in the simple routine, repetitive but familiar. Like the encroaching neighbor that, unprompted, mows your lawn, we are intrinsically protective of our territory. Explicitly marking known (or claimed) boundaries to signify our domain of control, if merely by trimming the hedges or painting some fences. This ritual delineates an extension of ourselves onto our possessions from the unknown wilderness: the abandoned yards, uncharted forests, unincorporated territory. Cleaning represents a continual re-exploration and reaffirmation of these uncertain and undetermined boundaries. We do not often venture beyond the liminal space.
