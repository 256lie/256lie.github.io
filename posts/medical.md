**Challenges in developing machine learning for clinical applications in healthcare systems**

* __Restricted data access__ - As health information is protected in many countries, access to large amounts of high-quality data resources can be difficult to acquire outside of major healthcare institutions. While some forms of health data can be collected relatively cheaply through consumer devices, other modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are only available at hospitals or clinical research centers. To avoid sharing restricted data, some groups have become interested in federated learning, which only require derivatives of the model e.g. parameter weights to be shared among participants.
* __Expert-level annotation__ - Depending on the clinical application use-case, data may need to be labeled and verified by the appropriate medical expert or specialist. Manually annotation of large datasets is a tedious and expensive process that may require multiple iterations to refine the annotation strategy and adjudicate difficult cases with ambiguous or rare conditions. Care should be taken to ensure that the cohort is representative of the desired population groups and minimal bias is introduced with respect to sex, gender, ethnicity or any other protected attribute of the patient. Some modes of bias may be difficult to fully detect or rectify, particularly if datasets are collected from different sites through different acquisition channels with varying protocols and parameters e.g. data acquired through MRI scanners of different manufactures from sites in different countries.
* __Deploying to clinical environments__ - Deployment of the model to clinical environments requires seamless integration into the clinicianâ€™s workflow. This integration process usually entails working with third-party vendors of clinical software as well as infrastructure teams internal to the healthcare system. Model inputs and outputs may need to conform to existing industry standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Additional training could be provided to application users e.g. clinicians and technicians and new human-computer interfaces (HCI) may be developed from user feedback to better leverage ML functionality.  
* __Navigating regulation__ - Regulatory acceptance and approval add an additional layer of complexity in the model development cycle. Software medical devices are usually subject to controls for proper management of quality and risk. Clinical trials may be conducted to validate performance across multiple sites and populations. Another consideration is that certain ML models can be continuously retrained or  as more data and/or higher-fidelity labels are collected. This ability can be advantageous in dealing with data distribution shift, recalibration to different subpopulations, or adjustments to changing clinical definitions of specific diseases. Continued discussion and research will be needed to develop regulation and procedures that can accommodate unique capabilities of ML-based medical devices that differ from traditional safety-critical software. Additionally, ethical questions in areas such as accountability and interpretability also warrant further study, especially of black-box techniques such as deep learning (DL).

While it could seem like there are many barriers that would hamper everybody except large healthcare systems  and their industry partners, many smaller companies do successfully break into this area as incumbents have yet to devise a dominating strategy and regulatory agencies are still solidifying comprehensive frameworks and processes. Despite challenges unique to medical systems, applications of machine learning to healthcare hold substantial potential for high-impact, commercially-viable projects.
