We characterize two common failures modes that arise in inefficient task performance. To personify these modes, we image two characters: Schmidt and Saposcat. Schmidt is the epitome of a productive and efficient human resource, whereas Saposcat is mediocre and unconscientious. With these two characters, first introduce two conceptualizations of productivity sinks --- operating modes characterized by inefficient resource allocation --- and then propose strategies for mitigation.

**Two kinds of failure**

We name these two failures $$\alpha$$ and $$\mathrm{A}$$ (from the Latin "acedia" meaning "without a care") --- to typify general patterns of erosiion in productivity (assume any reasonable definition or measure of productivity).

To borrow from probability theory, scale and location parameters describe the spread and center of a distribution; inappropriate settings of scale and location impede the efficacy in task completion and, subsequently, of goals (a goal necessitates completion of multiple tasks). $$\alpha$$ concerns inefficiency in "scale" while $$\mathrm{A}$$ concerns suboptimal estimates of "location" in performance of tasks to advance some goal or objective. $$\alpha$$ usually manifests when too much energy or focus is invested into a task; $$\mathrm{A}$$ manifests when the current task is misaligned or irrelevant to the intended goal.

Saposcat succumbs to $$\alpha$$ and $$\mathrm{A}$$ when he focuses too narrowly or deviates too far from the assigned task, accumulating friction by choosing tasks with low likelihood of furthering his objectives. On the other hand, Schmidt is more assiduous in investing only the required amount of resources while ensuring the current task is the one most appropriate in the current operating context.

$$\alpha$$ represents a failure in efficiently utilizing resources allocated to a task; $$\mathrm{A}$$ represents a failure to properly shift between levels of operation or abstraction, leading to suboptimal task prioritization. Both $$\alpha$$ and $$\mathrm{A}$$ feedback and interact --- $$\alpha$$ can lead to overexertion and depletion of resources through burn-out or scope creep, which leads to $$\mathrm{A}$$ through burn-in (*i.e.* a "sunk cost"; a failure to exit) and decision fatigue --- reinforcing inefficiencies into habits or blindspots.

Schmidt carefully considers the scope and impact of a task to avoid marginal gains. Schmidt also adjusts his tempo of performing --- like a conductor, matching the mood and pace appropriate for each section and cueing members before their part --- in a way that logically flows from one to another, avoiding any jarring transitions. Conversely, Saposcat haphazard fiddles with his baton, fumbling and dropping it on the ground, and picking his nose.

A table comparing $$\alpha$$ and $$\mathrm{A}$$.

|            |                          $$\alpha$$                          |            $$\mathrm{A}$$            |
| :--------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| Parameter  |                            Scale                             |             Location             |
|  Concerns  |                   Focus; detail; burn-rate                   |      Scheduling; allocation      |
|  Examples  | Burn-out; [stalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis); scope creep | Burn-in; sunk costs; saturation  |
| Indication | Lose of perspective; [fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) | Complacency to plateaux; erosion |



**Mitigation strategy**

How might we mitigate $$\alpha$$ and $$\mathrm{A}$$ --- so that Saposcat may act more like Schmidt?

For $$\alpha$$, reduce expenditure of resources (focus, energy, time, *etc.*) through [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) to smooth step functions into ramps:

* **Adjust zoom/window levels**
  * Affirm scope and cost is appropriate
  * Delegate to subject matter expert and defer low-priority tasks
  * Linearize to ignore higher-order complexity
  * *Skimming* --- triage relevance before processing *e.g.* read the title; then the table of contents; jump to specific chapters; stop at any time if material deemed not sufficiently pertinent
* **Stop multi-tasking**
  * Minimize overhead from context-switching
  * Prioritize resources for tasks which have the highest chance of advancing the goal
  * *Indexing* --- if not immediately relevant, index and reference for later retrieval
* **Avoid intricate tools** --- tools are extensions that must be maintained regularly and exercised
  * The beginner should not learn to drive in a racecar --- they must first learn the fundamentals of maneuvering and steering
  * Additional complexity and functionality must be justified against the opportunity cost to acquire, learn, and maintain
  * Simple tools are easy to use, maintain, and fix; a dull knife is worthless to the chef during the rush --- *mise en place*
  * Leverage creative constraints and do not spoil yourself --- remember that others have done more with less; do not blame your tools


For $$\mathrm{A}$$, there are higher-level mitigations:

* **Iterate faster** --- defer abstraction *e.g.* prefer shape over texture, form over detail, function over form
  * Increase [number of cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop);
    * Become familiar with the entire end-to-end process
    * Incorporating external feedback
    * Be more aware of mode shifts
  * [Do not optimize prematurely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization)
  * Quick baseline to assess difficulty and chokepoints/bottlenecks

* **Delineate shifts and practice shifting**
  * Acknowledge separate modes with names/characterization *e.g.* "editing", "sketching", "refactoring", "exploring", "theorizing"
  * Batch/coalesce similar tasks together *e.g.* shallow administration work such as checking emails once a day
  * Think of tradeoffs *e.g.* greedy versus optimal searches, function versus detail, prototype versus state-of-the-art

* **Set breakpoints** --- use dead space to debug and review and recalibrate

  * Have predefined completion criteria and exit conditions
  * Check in at fixed intervals progress and estimates with instrumentation and logging

  * Pause and reflect on the counterfactual/hypothetical (*e.g.* consider trade-offs between feasibility/impact vs. effort/risk)
  * Restarts or reboots or rewrites may be necessary if too much cruft has already accumulated

* **Keep few rules and simple processes** --- it is harder to subtract than to add; keep things simple enough for a mentally disadvantaged Saposcat

  * Fewer rules are easier to follow, remember, and ingrain into habits/mindsets
  * Beware the "meta-processes"; avoid excessive/intricate planning/tracking
  * Systems tend towards disorder over time
    * all processes compound and propagate their errors but complexity can hide longer symptoms of decay and staleness
    * as much as is possible, limit dependencies and coupling



**Beyond $$\alpha$$ and $$\mathrm{A}$$**

To eat our own dogfood, let us zoom out of our constructed dichotomy. Like Saposcat and Schmidt,  $$\alpha$$ and $$\mathrm{A}$$ are total fictional concepts, invented by us in order to illustrate and [operationalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization) recognizable patterns. Abstractions can quickly devolve into distractions, and the reader is well advised to ignore any or all of our advice (including this).

We intended to describe two general patterns that indicate breakdown in systems; systems that, as they grow in complexity, must more efficiently consume resources and produce control signals to influence their operation in constrained and dynamic environments.

We speculate that complex systems inherently benefit from acquiring/selecting more efficient and adaptive behaviors. An efficient system can be represented compactly, which facilitates its continued existence and propagation. For example, the genomic sequence is comprises four nucleotide bases and the few characters in the latin alphabet is flexible enough to create complex systems of communication and culture. Adaptive systems that are more robust to a wide dynamic range of environmental conditions are likely to have elements of redundancy or techniques for error correction in lossy communication channels. These attributes serve to preserve the system for the continuation of its evolutionary lifetime. Additionally, adaptivity of activation thresholds can reduce friction, allowing methods to escape local optima (saturating plateaux and basins) to find a better operating point on the Pareto front. While we make no normative claims about productivity or efficiency being inherently "positive", we generally observe that communication and synchronization within many varieties of complex systems are correlated with adaptive, regulating behaviors.



**Aside on procrastination loops**

Procrastination is often perceived as a detriment to productivity or as a flaw in character morale or social mores. However, we view procrastination as a complex feedback mechanism --- stemming from sensations of pain and exacerbated by normative pressures of modernity and technology. Fundamentally, procrastination is a psychological aversion or avoidance to assignments in favor of more immediately gratifying activities. The lack of disciplined self-control is only a proximal cause or procrastination. Several factors, external to individual control, also contribute. The modern individual is inundated with stimulus and access to distractions which were unfathomable to the prehistorical individual. Widespread availability to pathways to short circuit reward systems have led to several consequences such as increased prevalence of attention deficit, dysthymia, and anxiety. Rapid technological advances and integration have led to an exponential increase in information, decision, and opportunity. Everyday, we bear additional cognitive overhead of choosing among many potential options. While we may rely on some mental heuristics and leverage external tools, our processing capabilities are fundamentally limited; too much novelty saturates our senses; too many decisions lead to indecision. We become fatigued and default to distraction and entertainment --- the product of a hyper-capitalist society of consumption and growth --- which diminishes the productivity of the individual.



Finally, all tasks (and goals) should be:

1. **concrete and actionable**
2. **realistic and achievable**
3. **bounded and measurable**
