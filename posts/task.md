## Task management



Effective prioritization and execution of tasks requisite for the agent with volition. Objectives, which may or not be instrumental, are composed of tasks and subtasks to be achieved by the agent's actions and influence Inefficiencies arise in every operation and environment subject to reality. Here, we identify two sinks of productivity and propose some strategies for their mitigation.



**Two types of erosion**

Let us name the two general patterns of erosion in productivity (assume some reasonable definition of productivity):

1. $$\sigma$$  -- **erosion of focus**
   * waste in allocating energy (usually too much) to accomplish the task to sufficiency
   * poor utilization in dedicating optimal amount and type of resources to complete task
   * wrong level of effort leads to friction or fatigue
2. $$\mu$$ -- **erosion of alignment**
   * slowness to perceive mode shifts and adapt in dynamic environments 
   * poor estimation and prioritization of tasks to best further intended goals
   * pursing tasks that do not have the highest expected return



**Both $$\sigma$$ and $$\mu$$ contribute to suboptimal performance**

The appropriate level of detail and awareness is needed to triage incoming tasks and invest only the minimum required resources to maximize their chance of successful completion. Less relevant tasks should have lower priority in the queue. The scope of each task should be estimated and resources assigned accordingly. Deviations and uncertainties complicate tasks and add creeping complexity, which negatively affect efficiency and stresses the agent. Environmental factors also affect effectiveness. Changes in contexts necessitate changes in prioritization; cycling between levels of abstraction to best accommodate unexpected operating conditions. Tasks that have too low a likelihood of advantage are discarded in favor of tasks with more impact and chance of moving towards overall objectives. 

**Both $$\sigma$$ and $$\mu$$ interact and exacerbate the degradation**

Overexertion often leads to mistakes in decision-making and execution. Fatigue, sunk costs, and complacency can reinforce habituate routines and hide blindspots. Vicious cycles of depressed productivity and function result from strained resources and misdirected momentum. Burn-in and burn-out impede smooth transitions at a sustainable pace. The conductor must adjust tempo and match the mood to avoid jarring transitions and coordinate every section to the logical shifts of each piece.

**Erosion checklist**

We now detail six mitigation strategies to avoid erosion.

1. [Continuous cleanup](#clean) -- *mise en place* 
2. [Hard stuff first](#hard) -- more energy; better chance of success
3. [Simple tools](#simple) -- avoid premature intricacy
4. [Skimming](#skim) -- skim before committing
5. [Breakpoints and cues](#break) -- reminder to collect feedback and affirm 
6. [Finishing mindset](#finish) -- iterate and ingrain to find bottlenecks



<a name="clean">**Continuous cleanup**</a>

Systems tend towards disorder and regular cleanup is needed to prevent entropy from accumulating. Memory is periodically freed up. Dead branches needs to be trimmed. Knives have to be sharpened before use. Dirty operating environments clutter the space and can affect (even subconsciously) the mood and mindset of the agent. Unmaintained systems may become too broken to fix post hoc. Easier to perform regular updates and repairs while the mess is manageable and below the activation threshold. With some prior organization, unexpected loads become much less stressful organization.



<a name="hard">**Hard stuff first**</a>

By default, actions and decision-making are sequential -- a linear sequence of events resulting from a previous states in time. Precedence determines dependencies. The chef prepares ingredients with respect to order of operations: the oven preheated, the meat defrosted, the vegetables chopped. Just as reward in the present are more valuable than reward in the future, actions at the beginning of the sequence should be considered more carefully than actions at the end of the sequence. There is more uncertainty in future actions and usually more resources to commit at the start, when arduous tasks can be more easily tackled. Early moves allow more flexibility and set the direction for future paths to converge. Defer easier tasks and prioritize tasks which are most likely to advance the objective. Avoid unnecessary overhead from context-switching and leaks from orphaned processes. 



<a name="simple">**Use simple tools **</a>

Tools (and by extension their related workflows) should be appropriate for their users. Additional functionality and features add complexity and cost (to acquire and maintain). Expensive tools (and complicated workflows) are difficult for the novice to learn. Simple tools (and straightforward workflows) are appreciated by the expert to internalize. Why learn to drive in a race car? What does the mechanic drive to work every day? Practice with a constrained toolset. Options add (often necessary) overhead. Do not blame the tools at disposal (as others have done more with much less).



<a name="skim">**Skimming**</a>

 $$\sigma$$-erosion is usually caused from unexpected increases in expenditure of resources (e.g. focus, time, energy), disproportionate to the gain from completing the task. Quickly skimming to better estimate the expected utility and requirements of a task can help reduce $$\sigma$$  by:

* linearizing -- ignore higher-order complexity
* satisficing -- smooth step functions into ramps

* adjust zoom -- triage relevance before processing 

For example, if trying to determine if a book is currently relevant to completion of a task: read the title; then the table of contents; jump to specific chapters; stop at any time if the material is not sufficiently pertinent.



<a name="break">**Set breakpoints and cues**</a>

Set aside some time to review. Externalize and offload by leaving reminders -- cues and placeholders to come back to at a later point. A reference or index to do something. Utilize free space to recalibrate. Have predefined exit criteria to avoid losing too much. Reflect on the counterfactual and lessons learned. Make this process easy to follow and easy to remember. Avoid excessive setup, instrumentation, and tracking. Just enough to debug and move on. Avoid "meta-processes". Abstractions quickly devolve into distractions.



<a name="finish">**Build a habit of finishing**</a>

Defer abstraction by preferring: form over detail; function over form; shape over texture. Iterate faster over the entire lifecycle. Avoid dwelling on any particular stage for too long. Quickly baseline to assess difficulty and spot chokepoints. Become familiar with the end-to-end process. Limit dependencies and coupling. Systems breakdown over time but complexity can hide signs of decay as errors compound and propagate throughout different subparts. Premature optimization can mask these problems.



**Beyond $$\sigma$$ and $$\mu$$**

We have described two general modes of erosion in productivity. Complex agents must efficiently procure resources and exert influence for operation in dynamic environments. All intelligent systems with instrumental objectives inherently benefit from acquiring and development more efficient and adaptive behaviors (if only for continued existence of the agent itself). Several properties might serve to increase functioning efficiency: robustness in a wide range of environmental conditions, redundancy and compactness in representation, and adaptive signaling networks for regulation and control. 

For example, the genomic sequence comprises only four nucleotide bases and the characters of the Latin alphabet are flexible enough to create complex systems of communication and culture.

**Aside on procrastination**

Procrastination is perceived as a detriment to productivity. We view procrastination as a complex feedback mechanism --- stemming from the sensation of pain from normative pressures. Fundamentally, procrastination is the psychological aversion to stressful assignments in favor of activities that result in more immediate gratification. Absence of individual discipline is only a proximal cause of procrastination. Several factors, external to an individual's control, also contribute to its etiology. The individual is inundated with stimulus and easy access to distractions. Widespread availability and reinforcement of short circuit reward pathways have led decreased attention by increasing availability of alternative options without negatively affecting survival fitness. Rapid technological advancement and integration have led to exponential increases in decisions and options. Unequipped to deal with the additional cognitive burden, we rely on  biologically limited heuristics to choose between countless potential actions. Saturated and indecisive, we become more easily fatigued. More prone to default to distraction which is less effort as well as less productive.
