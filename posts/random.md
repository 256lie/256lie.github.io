> It is not a learned physician who sings incantations over pains which should be cured by cutting.

Bloodletting was a common medical practice for over 2000$$\pm$$50 years, previously practiced to alleviate symptoms of hypertension by reducing overall blood volume. The letting of blood was thought to reduce *humor* and practiced by barbers who applied numerous techniques with specifically designed instruments such as the razor, fleam, and scarificator. Bloodletting was used to treat a plethora of diseases and symptoms, even hemorrhaging. The popularity of bloodletting led to an industry of hirudiculture (after *hirudin*, an anticoagulant protein) in the 19th century, when hundreds of millions of leeches were applied throughout Europe. Famously, George Washington, developing a throat infection, had ~125 oz (3.75 liters) of blood let over a period of 10-hours before his death.



### Greek

It appears that the structure of the Greek language, specifically the fact that its alphabet was not based on a writing system like the Semitic (that omitted vowels in writing) or the Chinese (that was entirely based on ideograms), turned out to be a perhaps accidental but crucial intellectual advantage. Kerckhove (1981) suggests that, more than other writing systems, the completely phonetic alphabet favored left-hemisphere activity in the brain, thus providing more neurophysiological activity which could have better fostered more abstract, analytic thought.
