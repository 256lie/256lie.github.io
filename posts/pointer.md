Reference is relation between objects in which one objects connects/designates/links to another object. The first object in this relation _refers_ to the second object. The first object is called the _name_ of the second object; the second object is called the _referent_ of the first object. A name can be a phrase, expression, symbolic representation. A referent can by anything: a material object, a conceptual abstraction, an activity, or an event.

* Boston Brahmin, Harvard educated in chemistry
* Surveyor of geodesy and gramme try with pendulums
* Friends with William James
* Worked at Harvard's observatory
* Lectured in logic at John Hopkins
* Rival with Simon Newcomb
* Logical NOR: A ↓ B := ⌐A ∧ ⌐B


Three categories:

1. Fallibilism
   1. No belief can be conclusively justified
   2. Knowledge does not require certainty
   3. Almost no basic, non-inferred beliefs are certain or conclusively justified
2. Logic as formal semiotic on signs
3. Metaphysics realism/objective idealism


Aristotelian categories are adjuncts to reasoning designed to resolve equivocations, ambiguity in expressions or signs recalcitrant to being ruled by logic. Categories help reasoner render signs ready for application of logical laws. 

Sanders claims three categories are sufficient to unified manifolds meaning:

> I will now say a few words about what you have called Categories, but for which I prefer the designation Predicaments, and which you have explained as predicates of predicates. \\ That wonderful operation of hypostatic abstraction by which we seem to create entia rationis that are, nevertheless, sometimes real, furnishes us the means of turning predicates from being signs that we think or think through, into being subjects thought of. We thus think of the thought-sign itself, making it the object of another thought-sign. \\ Thereupon, we can repeat the operation of hypostatic abstraction, and from these second intentions derive third intentions. Does this series proceed endlessly? I think not. What then are the characters of its different members? \\ My thoughts on this subject are not yet harvested. I will only say that the subject concerns Logic, but that the divisions so obtained must not be confounded with the different Modes of Being: Actuality, Possibility, Destiny (or Freedom from Destiny). \\ On the contrary, the succession of Predicates of Predicates is different in the different Modes of Being. Meantime, it will be proper that in our system of diagrammatization we should provide for the division, whenever needed, of each of our three Universes of modes of reality into Realms for the different Predicaments. (Peirce 1906).


Peirce's Reduction thesis claims that three levels in the type hierarchy of three levels is sufficient for logic.

Table of Cenopythagorean categories 

| Order      | Definition                                              | Characterization               | As universe of experience  | As quantity                       | "adicity"                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Firstness  | Reference to a ground – a pure abstraction of a quality | Quality of feeling             | Ideas, chance, possibility | Vagueness "some"                  | Monadic – the quale in the sense of the _such_ – having the quality |
| Secondness | Reference to a correlate (by its relate)                | Reaction, resistance, relation | Brute facts, actuality     | Singularity, discreteness, "this" | Dyadic – the relate and the correlate                        |
| Thirdness  | Reference to an interpretant                            | Representation, mediation      | Habits, laws, necessity    | Generality, continuity, "all"     | Triadic – signs, objects interpretant                        |


Logic is formal semiotic – formal study of signs (artificial, indexical, linguistic, symbolic) and their representational and inferential relations. 

Inquiry process is sign processes (semiosis).

Logic divided into

1. Stechiology or speculative grammar – how signs can be meaningful, what kinds of signs can be meaningful, how signs combine, embody, or incorporate other signs
2. Logical critic/proper on modes of inference
3. Methoduetic or speculative universal rhetoric – philosophical theory of inquiry which includes pragmatism

Four incapacities imply reality is general and continuous

1. No power of introspection (all knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from external facts)
2. No power of Intuition (all mental action is inference [no cognitive stage comes absolutely first])
3. No power of thinking without signs (cognition must be interpreted in subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all)
4. No conception of the absolutely incognizable

A sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants



Intension is any property or quality connoted by a word, phrase or and symbol. A word's definition implies an intension. 

E.g. Intentions of the word "plant", include properties such as "being composed of "cellulose", "alive", "organism". A comprehension is the collection of all such intensions. 

Extension of a concept, idea, or sign consists of things to which it applies – implied or suggested: ideas, properties, corresponding signs, etc.

Extension of word "book" is the set that includes every dictionary, textbook, fiction novel, etc. 

Intension (also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation) and extension (also called breath, denotation, or application) integrate /unify to information.

Extension x intension = information

E.g. A database schema is an intension; a particular instance (row) of that database is an extension.

The extension of a concept $C$ is the set that is specified by $C$.

E.g. the extension of a function is a set of ordered pairs of arguments and values i.e. $$ {(a_1, v_1), (a_2, v_2), \ldots\} $$. See axiom of extensionality. 

Meaning of a word as bond between idea and physical form.

1. Signifier - e.g. "str('asdf')"
2. Signified - e.g. 
3. Referent – 

Intensional languages cannot be given adequate semantics in terms of extensions of expressions in them.

__Discrete__

* systems theory - self-organization, boundaries, replication, sustainability/persistence, hierarchical structure
* category/model theory - groups, fields, graphs, types, function composition, recursion, homomorphisms, closure
* control/stability theory - non-linearity, basins/sinks, attractors, convergence (Lyapunov function)


Free associations:

  * Dec 30 1:10 - bursts, cookies, belief in believing, maps mapped out, dreams keep but know the loneliness. Aliens are half-beings. Veneer. Patina. Similitude of really. Opposite of broken.  of isotropic space. Destined density; desiderata. Enigmatic engines of state. Automatons. End (of line) tokens. Redeemable for prizes. Recency. Subadditivity


  * found drama

> Discourse on real capitalism and academic hierarchies, research funding, scientificism, logical positivism, science skepticism, macro problems (climate) vs. incremental progress/implementation constrains

* Generalized linear models - keep weighted sum of features, but allow non-Gaussian outcome distributions and connect expected mean of this distribution and weighted sum through a possible non-linear function e.g. logistic regression assumes Bernoulli distribution for outcome and links expected mean and weighted sum using the logistic function
* surrogate models - purpose it to approximate prediction of underlying model as accurately as possible (approximation model, meta-model, response surface model, emulator)
* all models are wring - since all models are wrong  the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tiger around.
* brute fact - everything cannot be explained

* equifinality
* portable, transferable, multipliers
  * tooling/proficiency/levers – vim, git, programming, writing
  * mental - arithmetic, abstraction, design thinking, reasoning, pattern matching
  * interpersonal communication – public speaking, non-verbal, rhetoric
  * status/social - identity, signaling, presentation, appearance, attractiveness
  * individual cognitive – consciousness, intelligence, EQ, memory

* modes of verbal communication (transactional, informational, persuasive, discursive, banter, flirtation, smalltalk)
* Analogous thinking

Themes


1. * creation of artifact embody wills: beliefs, needs, hopes, desires, intentions

  * artifacts persist by transmission and preservation but eventually decay/degrade/evolve over time
  * derived artifacts corrupt/recombine original wills for new purposes
  * artist (advertising, musician, academic) vs. audience (mass, select, academics)
  * creative acts invent/repurpose artifacts with their will and passive acts absorb most of the original artifact and retransmits/preserves

2. arguments

  * meaning follows a binomial distribution correlated with disposition (IQ, locus of control, in-group, comparisons)
  * higher C/P ratio is more meaningful but follow Pareto distribution - low signal
  * majority is complacent and maintains current
  * evolutionary evolved to not constantly delegate reward systems to external stimulus/control

### (3)

1. Culture feedback into social-economic system
2. Raw capitalism naturally leads to winner-take-all and inequality in the limit without intervention
3. State intervention will be insufficient to keep pace with technological acceleration and increasing complexity
