**How do we choose what to pursue?**

David Foster Wallace (DFW) explores this question through several works in the context of postmodern, capitalist society. In the essay *E Unibus Pluram*, DFW argues that postmodern consumer culture is trapped in a loop of self-conscious and self-awareness that preclude authentic experience in a society inundated with irony and saturated in mass media *e.g.* television. In his speech *This is Water*, DFW warns us about the difficulty of empathic thinking --- to consciously choose how we perceive others and not default to the complacency that arise in the boredom and loneliness of everyday life. Reality lacks objectivity for the individual and constantly choosing to think for ourselves and feel for others is exhausting and becoming harder as distractions become more widespread, offering an easier default option of consumption and entertainment.

**What do we worship?**

In *Infinite Jest*, DFW poses possible examples through a plethora of characters in his expansive novel. Each character devotes themself to different pursuits given their socio-economic background, internal motivations, and external expectations. A rehabilitated Don represents the socio-economic disadvantaged; deprived of the opportunity to realize his physical talents in football, dropping out of school, and pursing a life of vulgarly and narcotics, Don later enters rehabilitation, worships his newfound abstinence, and risks his life in service of his position as the resident counselor in a recovery house. A prodigious Hal represents privilege and potential --- a rising junior tennis star at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA) founded by an overachieving, if somewhat dysfunctional, family. Hal is both intelligently and physically gifted but insecure and alienated --- receding to smoking cannabis in secret and suffering a breakdown that leaves him unable to communicate to others.

Don and Hal attempt to redefine themselves and "overcome" the default expectations of their backgrounds. Abstinence induces a drastic change in both characters that enable a more authentic reconciliation within themselves. Don derives meaning through continual relinquishing to an external higher power of Alcohol Anonymous (AA) while Hal experiences a realization of the external expectations for him to live up to his precociousness and successes of his family. ETA trains its youth to transcend plateaux in order to reach and stay in the "Show". In *Infinite Jest*, we perceive and can watch each characters' action --- every action a choice, even non-action. It does not prescribe any single, obvious interpretation, but leaves us to choose, to consciously think for ourselves, about out experience of consuming DFW's magnificent entertainment.

**Is resolution possible?**

In a progressively isolating society, we may feel abandoned in choice. Too many choices leads to fatigue and regret --- endless opportunities decrease the likelihood of picking the best choice. Drowning in access to easy stimulation makes authentic connection --- with ourselves and others --- more difficult and tedious. How do we overcome the default lifestyle circumscribed by our environment? Where is the individual left in a converging monoculture of a global mass? 

There are questions we wrestle with in everyday existence that DFW calls for us to individually and continuously think about. In sharing his our experiences, DFW leaves us more hopeful finding some consonance in a continually noisy world.
