**How do we choose what to pursue?**

David Foster Wallace (DFW) explores this question through several works in the context of a postmodern and consumer society. In the essay *E Unibus Pluram*, DFW argues that postmodern consumer culture is trapped in a loop of self-conscious self-awareness that preclude authentic experience in a society inundated with irony and saturated in mass media *e.g.* television. In his speech *This is Water*, DFW warns us about the difficulty of empathic thinking --- to consciously choose how we perceive others and to not default into complacency, plagued by the boredom and loneliness of everyday life. Reality lacks true objectivity for the individual; constantly having to think for ourselves and feel for others is exhausting and becomes harder as distractions become more widespread, which offer the easy default option of pure consumption and entertainment.



**What do we worship?**

In *Infinite Jest*, DFW poses several possibilities through a plethora of characters in his expansive novel. Each devotes themself to different pursuits given their socio-economic background, internal motivations, and external expectations. A rehabilitated Don represents the socio-economically disadvantaged. Deprived of the opportunity to realize his physical talents in football by dropping out of school and pursing a life of burglary and narcotics, Don later enters rehabilitation and finds meaning in abstinence, even risking his life to protect a fellow addict as the resident counselor in a recovery house. Hal represents privilege and potential --- a rising junior tennis star at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA) founded by an overachieving, if somewhat dysfunctional, family. Hal is a prodigy, both mentally and physically, but insecure and alienated --- receding in secret to smoke cannabis and suffering a breakdown that leaves him unable to communicate.

Both Don and Hal attempt to redefine themselves and overcome the default expectations and constraints of their respective backgrounds. Abstinence results in drastic changes for both characters that enable more authentic reconciliation with their experiences. Don derives meaning through continual surrender to the external higher power of Alcohol Anonymous (AA) while Hal experiences a realization of the external expectations to live up to his precociousness and family's successes. ETA trains its youth to transcend plateaux in order to reach and stay in the "Show". Through the act of reading *Infinite Jest*, we literally sympathize and perceive each character and their actions --- every action is a choice, even non-action. *Infinite Jest* does not prescribe a single, obvious interpretation, but leaves us to choose, to consciously think for ourselves, about our experience of consuming DFW's entertainment.

**Is resolution possible?**

In a progressively isolating society, we may feel abandoned to choose. Too many choices leads to fatigue and regret as endless opportunities decrease the likelihood of making the optimal decision. Drowning in access to easy stimulation makes authentic connection --- with ourselves and with others --- difficult and tedious. How do we overcome default lifestyles circumscribed by external influences of a marginalizing society? Where is the individual (and what are they left) with in a converging monoculture of a global mass? 

There are questions we wrestle with that DFW wants us to consider carefully and continuously. In sharing his experiences through literature, DFW leaves us more hopeful --- by listening to our anxieties and struggles --- in finding some meaningful consonance in an increasing noisy world.
