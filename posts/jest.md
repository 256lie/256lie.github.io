**How do we choose our pursuits?**

David Foster Wallace (DFW) explores this question through several literary works in the context of a postmodernist consumer society. In his essay *E Unibus Pluram*, DFW argues that postmodernist culture is trapped in a self-conscious loop of ironic self-awareness that precludes authentic experiences in a society inundated with mass media (television, literature, advertisements). In his commencement speech *This is Water*, DFW emphasizes about the difficulty of empathic thinking --- a choice to consciously choose how to perceive others and not choose the default of complacent indifference --- exacerbated by the daily tedium, boredom, and loneliness that awaits every adult. In a reality that lacks any objective truth or meaning, the individual that is constantly thinking for themselves and feeling for others is fated to be exhausted, prone to increasing available distractions afforded by a techno-capitalist society; a modern society that offers enticing options of consumption through entertaining advertisements that acknowledge and even ridicule with the meta-irony the capitalist motivation in relation to the individual consumer.

**What and how do we worship?**

In the acclaimed fiction *Infinite Jest*, DFW explores some possibilities  through several characters of his expansive novel. We analyze only the two main protagonists: Don and Hal. Each of whom devotes themselves to seemingly disparate pursuits largely determined by their opposing socio-economic backgrounds, in which external expectations and influences contend with their internal motivations as an individual. A rehabilitated Don represents the socio-economically disadvantaged --- deprived opportunities to realize his physical talents in football; he instead attracted into burglary and narcotics. Don later enters rehabilitation and discovers purpose through continued abstinence, even risking his life and enduring excruciating pain to uphold this adherence to a "higher power" subscribed by Alcohol Anonymous (AA). Hal represents privilege and potential --- a rising tennis prodigy at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA) founded and overseen by his overachieving, if somewhat dysfunctional, family. Hal is talented, both physically and intellectually, but insecure and alienated --- he recedes underground to consume cannabis in secret and suffers a mental breakdown that leaves him unable to communicate externally (but able to feel and empathize internally).

Both Don and Hal try to redefine themselves by overcoming the normative constraints and expectations of their respective. The abstinence from their chemical addictions results in major character changes, which seem to enable a more authentic reconciliation with their individual experiences (from the losing of potential and agency for Don and the pressure to succeed and that realization for Hal). Don derives his new set of values through continual reaffirmation and surrender to an external higher power (not exactly prescribed by AA) while Hal has the personal realization of his emotionally detachment from years of distancing as a result of family trauma and the rigorous regime of ETA (which prescribes a philosophy of walling the individual player off from all external factors outside of the game) to overcome and  transcend everyone (especially oneself) --- to get off the plateaux in order to reach the "Show" (i.e. the professional tennis circuit). As readers of *Infinite Jest*, we also perceive and empathize with DFW's characters --- their experiences, their struggles, and their actions (every action is a choice, even non-action). While *Infinite Jest* is singular in its unique style and gripping exposition, the novel does not present a single or clear interpretation --- rather making the point of leaving us to have to choose and to deliberately interpret (even the ending must be inferred) our personal experience of consuming DFW's entertainment about entertainment.

**Is there a resolution?**

As we progress, develop, advance, *et cetera*, we become more aware of our place as the individual (a personal story of failing to achieve or achieving to achieve) in a society --- composed of other individuals with their separate stories --- that has progressed to the late-stages of capitalism, resulting in:

* The fatigue (and regret) of having to decide among an exponential number of potential choices (which we are unlikely to have chosen the optimal [but will never know the actual counterfactual; only estimated probabilities])
* The self-conscious insecurity of seeing others succeed (in media) that result in uncalibrated expectations that are destined to lead inevitably to failure, disappointment, and apathy.
* The commodification, stratification, and marginalization of the individual into a consumer --- a reduction (to a customer segment or demographic) that produces feelings of anxiety / depression / alienation / loneliness, side effects from a realization of their predicament as the individual, the modern addict.

DFW warned against an ensuing isolation stemming from the lack of authentic experience and empathy in a converging monoculture of mass saturation. Abandoned (or at {best, worst} only advertised) to choose from an endless menu of options is cognitively draining and induces regret for the rational consumer. How do we deal with (limitations of our human sense and cognition to overcome) the overload of stimuli and decisions? How to consciously choose, not just the easy defaults of the masses but, the more difficult choices requiring empathic and conscious thinking? How to continuously choose to consider whether our experiences are authentic, and then to act according to that notion of authenticity?

These questions that DFW poses to us for deliberate consideration are not intended to be sophistical or satirical (although some of his writing utilize satire and sophistry); these are practical (but subjective) questions that everyone faces: willfully, ignorantly, or terminally. Through his considerable contributions to literature and popular culture, DFW leaves us more hopeful and inspired --- by hearing our disquiet and articulating them authentically --- to find the consonance within the cacophony of our everyday realities. A message that continues to resonate in an increasing noisy world.
