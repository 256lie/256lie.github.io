**How do we choose our pursuits?**

David Foster Wallace (DFW) explores this question through several literary works in the context of a postmodernist consumer society. In his essay *E Unibus Pluram*, DFW argues that postmodernist culture is trapped in a self-conscious loop of ironic self-awareness that precludes authentic experiences in an inundated society saturated with mass media (television, literature, advertisements). In his commencement speech *This is Water*, DFW emphasizes about the difficulty of empathic thinking --- a choice to consciously choose how to perceive others and to not default to the complacency --- hindered by the daily tedium, boredom, and loneliness that awaits every adult. In a reality that lacks objective truth or meaning, the individual that must constantly think for themselves and feel for others is fated to be exhausted and prone to increasing available distractions afforded by modern society; a capitalist society that offers the individual the enticing option of consumption through entertaining advertisements that acknowledge and ridicules the meta-irony of its capitalist relationship with the individual consumer.

**What and how do we worship?**

In the acclaimed fiction *Infinite Jest*, DFW explores some possible postmodern deities through several characters in his expansive novel. We analyze only the two major protagonists: Don and Hal. Both devotes themselves to disparate pursuits largely determined by their opposite socio-economic backgrounds, in which external expectations and influences contend with the internal motivations of the individual. A rehabilitated Don represents the socio-economically disadvantaged --- deprived of opportunities to realize his physical talents in football to instead pursue burglary and narcotics, Don later enters rehabilitation and discovers a derived purpose through his abstinence, even risking his life and enduring excruciating pain to uphold his adherence to a "higher power" subscribed by Alcohol Anonymous (AA). Hal represents privilege and potential --- a junior tennis prodigy at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA) founded and overseen by his overachieving, if somewhat dysfunctional, family. Hal is talented, both physically and intellectually, but also insecure and alienated --- he recedes underground to consumer cannabis in secret and suffers a mental breakdown that leaves him unable to communicate externally (but able to feel and empathize internally).

Don and Hal try to redefine themselves by overcoming default constraints and pressures placed by their respective backgrounds. Abstinence from illegal drug use results in extreme character changes which enable a more authentic reconciliation with their individual experiences. Don derives this meaning through his continual reaffirmation and surrender to another external higher power prescribed by AA while Hal has a personal realization of how emotionally detached be has become as a result of external expectations and the rigorous training regime (with a philosophy of abstracting the individual from the external influences and pressures of professional athletic competition) of ETA to motivate and to strive for the transcendence of plateaux in performance to achieve the "Show" (i.e. the professional tennis circuit). Through the act of reading *Infinite Jest*, we as readers (literally) perceive and empathize with DFW's characters --- their experiences, their struggles, their actions (every action is a choice, even non-action). While *Infinite Jest* is singular its style and exposition, the novel does not present a single, clear interpretation --- rather making the point of leaving us to consciously choose and to deliberately think about our personal experience of consuming DFW's entertainment about our entertainment.

**Is there a resolution?**

As we progress, advance, modernize, develop, grow, etc, we become more aware of our place as an individual in society: 

* The fatigue (and regret) of deciding among an increasing number of choices to pursue, 
* The self-consciousness of others' successes that result in unrealistic expectations and inevitable disappointment in failure
* The commodification, stratification, and marginalization of the individual into consumer segments --- producing alienation and loneliness from the realization of their predicament.

DFW warned against the ensuing isolation from a lack of authentic connection in a converging monoculture of mass consumerism. Abandoned (or at best/worst advertised) to choose from endless options is cognitively draining and induces regret and apathy. How can we overcome the overload of stimuli and decisions? How to consciously choose not the default option but the more difficult choice of empathic, conscious thinking? How to continuously choose what we consider authentic experiences and act towards that authenticity?

There are among the questions that DFW poses to us for extremely careful consideration --- there are practical questions of finding subjective meaning in life. Through his contribution to literature and culture, DFW leaves us more hopeful --- by hearing our disquiet and articulating them --- to find some meaningful consonance in the cacophony of our reality.
