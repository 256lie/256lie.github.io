**How do we choose our pursuits?**

David Foster Wallace (DFW) explores this question through several literary works in the context of a postmodernist consumer society. In his essay *E Unibus Pluram*, DFW argues that postmodernist culture is trapped in a self-conscious loop of ironic self-awareness that precludes sincerity in a society inundated with mass media e.g. television, literature, advertisements. In his commencement speech *This is Water*, DFW emphasizes the difficulty of empathic thinking --- to consciously choose to perceive others and not default to complacent indifference --- a condition exacerbated by the daily tedium, boredom, and loneliness awaiting every well-adjusted person. In a reality without any objective truth or meaning, the individual that is constantly thinks about themselves and feels for others is destined to be exhausted and prone to retreat to increasing available distractions afforded by contemporary society --- a society of abundance that advertises enticing entertaining which acknowledge the ridiculous meta-ironic their capitalist relationship to the individual consumer.

**What and how do we worship?**

In the regarded work of fiction, *Infinite Jest*, DFW explores some possibilities to this question in several characters of his expansive novel. We analyze only the two main protagonists: Don and Hal. Both devote themselves to disparate pursuits largely determined by their opposing socio-economic backgrounds, background in which external expectations / influences contend with their internal motivations as the individual. A rehabilitated Don represents the socio-economically disadvantaged --- deprived opportunities to realize his physical talents in football, he falls a life of burglary and narcotics. Don later enters rehabilitation and derives meaning through Alcoholic Anonymous' (AA) abstinence program, even risking his life and enduring excruciating pain to adhere/uphold this devotion to the "higher power" subscribed by AA. While favor missed Don, it struck Hal, the personification of privilege and potential --- a rising tennis prodigy at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA), an academy founded and overseen by his extremely talented to the point of overachieving, while somewhat dysfunctional, family. Hal is gifted, both physically and intellectually, but insecure and alienated --- he secretly recedes underground to use cannabis. A Hal in withdrawal suffers a mental breakdown that leaves him internally emotional but completely unable to communicate to the outside world.

Both Don and Hal try to overcome normative constraints/expectations of their respective contexts as mature/maturing individuals in a hyperrealist society. The abstinence from chemical dependence seems to result in major changes for the two protagonists, changes which enable more authentic reconciliation with their individual experiences. Don both loses and finds himself in AA while Hal confronts his blunt affect towards ETA's pressure to succeed/win. Don acquires a new set of values through the continual reaffirmation and surrender to a subsuming external power while Hal realizes his emotionally detachment/distancing from others reinforced by familial trauma, cannabis dependence, and ETA's rigorous training regime --- a regime that prescribes a philosophy of walling off the individual from all external factors outside of the game; to overcome and transcend the plateaux to reach the "Show" i.e. the professional tennis circuit. As participant consumers of *Infinite Jest*, we also perceive and we empathize with DFW's characters: their experiences, their struggles, their choices, and their actions, even non-actions. While *Infinite Jest* is a singular behemoth of style and exposition (several chapters could well stand alone as separate, prescient essays such as wearing fake face masks during video calls), the novel does not present a single or clear interpretation --- rather it makes the point of leaving us to choose; to consciously/deliberately interpret (as even the ending is not explicit and must be inferred from several textual clues) our experience of consuming DFW's entertainment about entertainment.

**Is resolution possible?**

As we progress/develop/advance, we become more aware of our place as individuals, individuals with a personal story of failing to achieve or achieving to achieve in society, the society composed of many other individuals with separate stories/threads. We progress past points of late stage capitalism which result in:

* Fatigue (and regret) of having to decide among an excessive number of choices (our actual decision unlikely to be optimal, leading to non-constructive regret)
* Self-conscious insecurities/jealousies of seeing others succeed (in the various forms of media broadcast at scale through even local networks) that result in unrealistic expectations destined for disappointment and then apathy.
* Commodification/stratification/marginalization of the individual into *just* a consumer of goods --- a reduction to some customer segment/demographic, a reduction that produces feelings of anxiety/alienation/loneliness; these side effects resulting from a realization of their predicament as the addict or prodigy.

DFW warned against this ensuing isolation from lack of sincerity and empathy; isolation in a converging monoculture of mass saturation. Abandoned (or at best/worst only advertised) to choose from endless menus of options which cognitively drain and induce regret for irrational consumers. How might we deal? With limitations of individual cognition? With the overload of stimuli and decisions? How to consciously choose, not just the easy defaults but, the more difficult choices requiring empathic and conscious deliberation/consideration/reflection? How to continuously choose more authentic and sincere experiences over cynicism and irony?

These questions posed to us for contemplation are not intended to be sophistical or satirical (although his writing heavily utilizes satire and sophistry), but practical matters and subjective questions that everyone must face: willfully, ignorantly, or terminally. Through his considerable contributions to literature and culture, DFW leaves us hopefully more inspired --- by articulating our disquiet --- to find some consonance mixed in the cacophony of our everyday realities. A message that continues to resonate in a world saturated with noise.
