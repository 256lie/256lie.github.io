> The basic intuition behind information theory is that a likely event should have low information content, less likely events should have higher information content and independent events should have additive information.

> Exact marginalization over continuous parameters is a macho activity enjoyed by those who are fluent in definite integration.

> Religion is a social institution that evolved as an integral mechanism of human culture to create and promote myths, to encourage altruism and reciprocal altruism, and to reveal the level of commitment to cooperate and reciprocate among members of the community. That is to say, religion evolved as the social structure that enforced the rules of human interactions before there were such institutions as the state or such concepts as laws and rights [...] The principal social institution available to facilitate cooperation and goodwill was probably religion. An organized establishment with rules and morals with a hierarchical structure so necessary for social primates, and with a higher power to enforce the rules and punish their transgressor, religion evolved as the penultimate effort of these pattern-seeking, storytelling, myth making animals.

> The cells of an organism are nodes in a richly interwoven communications network, transmitting and receiving, coding and decoding. Evolution itself embodies an on going exchange of information between organism and environment.

> What we call reality, arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions. All things physical are information-theoretic in origin, and this a participatory universe.

> In the man-machine systems of the past, the human operator supplied the initiative, the direction, the integration, and the criterion. The mechanical parts of the systems were mere extensions, first of the human arm, then of the human eye.

> About 85 per cent of my "thinking" time was spent getting into a  position to think, to make a decision, to learn something I needed to know. Much more time went into finding or obtaining information than into digesting it. Hours went into the plotting of graphs, and other hours into instructing an assistant how to plot. When the graphs were finished, the relations were obvious at once, but the plotting had to be done in order to make them so. At one point, it was necessary to compare six experimental determinations of a function relating speech-intelligibility to speech-to-noise ratio. No two experimenters had used the same definition or measure of speech-to-noise ratio. Several hours of calculating were required to get the data into comparable form. When they were in comparable form, it took only a few seconds to determine what I needed to know.

> Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once. Not the same , but related. One is about structure, one is about execution. Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.

> The result of all this was an articulation of *eidetic structures*; the essential structures; the essence of what appears in our awareness of the world. What is left after the elimination of all ontological assumptions are the processes of human consciousness and their objects, understood now not as independent objects in the outer world, but as "unities" of "sense" or "meaning" in the "inner world" of the conscious individual. The result is also a better understanding of the *constituting* activity that is involved in awareness of phenomena.

> Any analytic approach requires an *objectification* of the phenomenon being studied: that is to say, it turns that phenomenon into an object, something one examines in a more detached and reflective manner (though never in a fully neutral or disinterested manner).

> The sociology of knowledge understands human reality as socially constructed reality. Since the constitution of reality has traditionally been a central problem of philosophy, this understanding has certain philosophical implications. Insofar as there has been a strong tendency for this problem, with all the questions it involves, to become trivialized in contemporary philosophy, the sociologist may find himself, to his surprise perhaps, the inheritor of philosophical questions that the professional philosophers are not longer interested in considering.

> When it comes to choosing problems you’ll hear academics talk  about a mystical sense of “taste”. It’s a real thing. When you pitch a potential problem to your adviser  you’ll either see their face contort, their eyes rolling, and their  attention drift, or you’ll sense the excitement in their eyes as they  contemplate the uncharted territory ripe for exploration. In that split  second a lot happens: an evaluation of the problem’s importance,  difficulty, its sexiness, its historical context (and possibly also its  fit to their active grants). In other words, your adviser is likely to  be a master of the outer loop and will have a highly developed sense of  taste for problems. During your PhD you’ll get to acquire this sense  yourself.

> Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the  current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be *cited*, put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is  absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid  outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts  without any center or absolute anchorage [*ancrage*]. This  citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the  mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called "normal."  What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?

> The living being is stable. It must be in order not to be destroyed, dissolved or disintegrated by the colossal forces, often adverse, which surround it. By an apparent contradiction it maintains its stability only if it is excitable and capable of modifying itself according to external stimuli and adjusting is response to the stimulation. In a sense it is stable because it is modifiable  --- the slight instability is the necessary condition fo the true stability of the organism. 

> The human organism tries to establish internal congruity among cognitions such as attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about oneself and the environment. When a person holds two cognitions that are incompatible, dissonance is produced. But such dissonance can be reduced through selective exposure, that is, individuals will seek out information that will reduce the dissonance and avoid information that will increase the already existing dissonance.
