### Pachinko

Pachinko is one of the largest gambling industries with revenue surpassing that of Las Vegas, Macau, and Singapore combined$^1$. Pachinko parlours popped up in post-war Japan, where pachinko vendors devised ways to legally bypass gambling laws. During the following period of strong economic growth and industrialization, electronic pachinko machines began to replace mechanical ones, allowing the incorporation of more gratifying techniques of novel stimulus such as jackpots and digitalized visual interaction. Additional conveniences --- such as attached restaurants and dedicated locations in the suburbs --- enticed players to spend even more time in their parlours and contributed to their widespread popularity in society.

### Mismatch to modernity

Historically, technology has evolved as a faster rate than their inventors. Now, biological bodies are misaligned to deal with conditions of modernity produced by the rapid pace of techo-social ecosystems. Environments of our ancestors were vastly different and genetic traits selected to optimize reproductive fitness in their premodern conditions. Now we face a mismatch between our ancient genes and the modern  experience (in developed nations) of longer lifespans as a result of healthcare (e.g. surgical and pharmaceutical interventions), the influence of culture (reading, alcohol), and technology (e.g. artificial lighting, social media), leading to maladaptive health conditions that had much lower incidence in premodern populations

A longer but more sedentary life has replaced high mortality with high morbidity. The individual has replaced physical with mental activity. Society has provisioned sufficient convenience, complexity, and calories to last multiple hundreds of lifetimes. The modern human has abundance in opportunity of \{gratific, sati\}ation yet still carries the genetic pre\{dilec, disposi\}tions towards old habits of scarcity --- the impulsive cravings succumb to modern attractions of sugar, elevators, and movies. The experience of novelty and risk-seeking are ingrained traits; behavioral traits that \{com, im\}pel would be prehistoric hunters-gamblers into absorbing the instantaneous determinations of fate --- reward and fortune flash and sound; one witnesses the payout of a nearby jackpot, this perceived stimuli trigger the release of several neurotransmitters that strengthen feedback pathways, a previous vestige of selection is now granted the opportunity  in the epigenetic circuits.

### Reward pathways

We design artificial agents in our likeness --- to seek reward and avoid cost --- but without the sentimental suffering (yet). Principle of the under-determination and overexploitation lead our agents to optimize whatever is most easy without regard of our moral prescriptions or intentions. Cheating has no negative connotation if there is no explicit penalty. Indeed, "cheating" is just another solution that may best optimize the specified function. Cheating is a human problem. Normative notions and semantics are anthropic inventions. There is no agency. No capacity to feel happy or sad. Perhaps confused or bored (overly complex tasks or badly specified loss functions lead to underachieving or bewildering performance). Boring is not bad; boring is boring. Machines are happy to be boring.


### Stoic short circuit

One common approach taken to confront this unreasonable silence is to fill the void with dialogue, conversation, and self-talk. A less common (and arguably more difficult) escape is through transcendence, meditation, or dehumanization (giving the individual self up to be subsumed by an external cause, group, organization, religion, ideology, et cetera). In some sense, a return to material forms is this regression to the man of the past without the overhead of modernity. No burdens but survival, if even that. A pragmatic realization of the situation one finds in continued existence.

> Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid. To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint.
